Hey , welcome to the miniHackathon Prelim Test  
Here we just want to get you up and running with a few things and to get yous folks to use github and submit a tiny program in python to show that you know the super basic stuff . Alright lets get started  

# Task
- First Fork this repo  
- Install Github Desktop if you dont already have it  
- Clone your repo locally and open your code editor  
- Make a copy of the 'your-username' folder and rename it to your github username  
- Inside the folder there is a test file and the file you are going to work on , open it on your code editor and complete the program instructed there
- Test it locally using the command `python -m unittest <filename ending with _test.py>`
- If it passes and says OK go to the next step , if not try fixing it , it should be an easy fix  
- Make a commit of your solution and then make a PR to the main repo , it will do some automated testing on your code to see if things work .
- If it passes you are qualified and can now apply for the event  
- Go to the luma registration page and enter your PR link while registering
- If all went well , you will get your approval soon.
  
If along the way you face any difficulties or get stuck anywhere , watch the companion video , DM me if its stil not working .  
  
Thats it , Have Fun !
